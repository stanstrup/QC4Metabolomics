Title: Advanced Tables for Markdown/HTML
Author: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Maintainer: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Description: Tables with state-of-the-art layout elements such as row
    spanners, column spanners, table spanners, zebra striping, and
    more. While allowing advanced layout, the underlying css-structure
    is simple in order to maximize compatibility with word processors
    such as 'MS Word' or 'LibreOffice'. The package also contains a few
    text formatting functions that help outputting text compatible with
    HTML/'LaTeX'.
