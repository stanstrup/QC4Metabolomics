Some TODOs:

1) (from Marc)

Add a function to the templates for all the classes to make the
datacache available do this before we push out new devel packages in
January. So near to where you see: 
@ANNOBJPREFIX@_dbInfo <- function() dbInfo(datacache) 
Add something that will produce:
hgu95av2_datacache(), once it has been called.

2) Defunct CHR* family and PFAM and PROSITE. Coordinate with AnnotationForge.
