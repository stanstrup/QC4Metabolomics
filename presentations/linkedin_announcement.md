Iâ€™m excited to share a new, user friendly, comprehensive tool for real-time quality control of metabolomics data: QC4Metabolomics.

QC4Metabolomics is an open-source, real-time monitoring system that tracks your LC-MS data quality *as samples are being analyzed*. Think of it as a dashboard for your instrument's health that alerts you to problems before they ruin your entire batch.

**Features**

* **Real-time monitoring** of retention time, mass accuracy, and peak intensity
* **Contamination detection** using a database of 800+ known contaminants
* **Automated alerts** when quality parameters exceed thresholds
* **Easy deployment** via Docker containers
* **Modular design** - customize for your lab's needs

The tool is described in the paper, "QC4Metabolomics: Real-Time and Retrospective Quality Control of Metabolomics Data", which was published last week in Analytical Chemistry. Big thanks to my co-author Lars Ove Dragsted and everyone who contributed to feedback, testing, and discussions along the way.
We hope this tool helps the community safeguard valuable data and resources while improving reproducibility in #metabolomics research.
