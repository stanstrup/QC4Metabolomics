## R Keeping raw data in tibbles

Tibbles are similar to data frames with a few tricks up its sleave. One is that you can use so called list columns.
So instead of having datasets (or LC-MS raw data) in a list or in different variables it can be in one table with associated meta data.

Lets take some raw data data and make it into a table. We will do this in the pipe/dplyr way just because we can.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(MetabolomiQCsR)
library(dplyr)
library(faahKO)
```

```{r xcmsRaw_to_tbl}
files <- file.path(find.package("faahKO"), "cdf/KO") %>% 
         list.files(full.names=TRUE)
 
files %>% xcmsRaw_to_tbl
```
