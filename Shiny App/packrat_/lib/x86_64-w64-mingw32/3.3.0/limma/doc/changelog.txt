12 Jan 2016: limma 3.30.8

- Bug fix to fitFDist() when 'covariate' is not NULL. The new
  estimate for df2 will usually be slightly lower than before.  This
  affects the eBayes(trend=TRUE) pipeline.  The difference will have
  an appreciable effect on downstream results when the number of
  genes is small.

- fitFDist() now estimates the scale by mean(x) when df2 is estimated
  to be Inf.  This will make the results from eBayes() less
  conservative than before when df.prior=Inf.

- Bug fix to fitFDist() when 'x' contains NA values and 'df1' has
  length 1.  When 'covariate' is non-NULL, fitFDist() will now return
  an NA result without an error if there are too few observations to 
  do the estimation.

 - decideTests() is now an S3 generic function with a default method
  and a method for MArrayLM objects.

14 Dec 2016: limma 3.30.7

- Bug fix for contrastAsCoef() when there is more than one contrast.
  Previously the coefficients for the transformed design matrix were
  correct only for the first contrast.

28 Nov 2016: limma 3.30.6

- plotSA() now indicates, by way of an open plotting symbol, any
  points that have low robust df.prior values.

25 Nov 2016: limma 3.30.5

- Clearer error message from fitFDistRobustly() when some variances
  are zero.

16 Nov 2016: limma 3.30.4

- Bug fix for kegga() when the universe is explicitly specified.

10 Nov 2016: limma 3.30.3

- Bug fix for fitFDistRobustly() when there is an extreme outlier.
  Previously floating point underflow for the outlier p-value could
  cause an error.

27 Oct 2016: limma 3.30.2

- New function coolmap(). This is essentially a wrapper for the
  heatmap.2() function in the ggplots package, but with sensible
  default settings for genomic log-expression data.

26 Oct 2016: limma 3.30.1

- Argument 'replace.weights' removed from voomWithQualityWeights().
  The function now always produces an EList, similar to voom(). The
  default behavior of the function is unchanged.

  trying to save extra (undocumented) results that had not been
  computed.

17 Aug 2016: limma 3.29.19

- duplicateCorrelation() now expands weights using expandAsWeights(),
  making it consistent with lmFit().

  organism package exists.

- The 'species' argument of kegga() can now accept any Bioconductor
  species abbreviation.

- topGO() now breaks ties by the number of genes in the GO Term and
  by the name of the Term if the p-values are equal. (This is the
  same behavior as topKEGG.)

22 Jun 2016: limma 3.29.11

- alias2Symbol() and alias2SymbolTable() now work for any species for
  which an Entrez Gene based organism package exists.

15 Jun 2016: limma 3.29.10

- new argument 'annotation' for read.idat(), to allow users to read
  any required columns from the manifest file.

14 Jun 2016: limma 3.29.9

- normalizeBetweenArrays() now checks whether the input 'object' is a
  data.frame, and converts to a matrix if possible.

13 Jun 2016: limma 3.29.8

- new function detectionPValues() to compute detection p-values from
  negative control probes.

12 Jun 2016: limma 3.29.7

- new argument 'verbose' for read.idat().

- Example code added to duplicateCorrelation.Rd.

 4 Jun 2016: limma 3.29.6

- The default settings for the 'inter.gene.cor' and 'use.neg.cor'
  arguments of camera() have been changed.  camera() now uses by
  default a preset value for the inter-gene correlation. This has the
  effect that it tends to rank highly co-regulated,
  biologically-interpretable more highly than before.

22 May 2016: limma 3.29.5

- New function fitmixture() to estimate genewise fold changes and
  expression values from mixture experiments.  Previously this
  funtion was only available as part of the illumina package available
  from http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/illumina

- New function logcosh() to compute log(cosh(x)) accurately without
  floating underflow or overflow.

11 May 2016: limma 3.29.4

- Slight change to fry() standardize="posterior.sd" method.

10 May 2016: limma 3.29.3

- New flexibility for the roast() and mroast() functions, similar to
  that previously implemented for fry().  The index vector for each
  gene set can now be a data.frame, allowing each gene set to have
  its own set of gene weights.  The indices can now optionally be a
  vector of gene names instead of a vector of indices.  roast() and
  mroast() now support the robust empirical Bayes option of
  squeezeVar().  roast() and mroast() can now accept, via '...', any
  argument that would be normally passed to lmFit() or eBayes().

- bug fix to propTrueNull() when method="hist" and all the p-values
  are less than 1/nbins.

 5 May 2016: limma 3.29.2

- update NEWS.Rd ready for Bioconductor 3.3 release.

18 April 2016: limma 3.27.19

- bug fix for fry(), which is some cases was reversing the sign of a
  contrast effect.

15 April 2016: limma 3.27.18

- tmixture.vector() now handles unequal df in a better way.  This
  will be seen in slightly changed B-statistics from topTable when
  the residual or prior df are not all equal.

14 April 2016: limma 3.27.17

- Improved capabilities and power for fry().  fry() has two new
  arguments, 'geneid' and 'standardize'.  The index argument of
  fry() can now be a list of data.frames containing identifiers and
  weights for each set.  The options introduced by the standardize
  argument allows fry() to be more powerful when genes have unequal
  variances.  fry() now accepts any arguments that would be suitable
  for lmFit() or eBayes().

13 April 2016: limma 3.27.16

- alias2Symbol() and alias2SymbolTable() now load the name space of
  the relevant organism package org.XX.eg.db instead of loading the
  package.

10 April 2016: limma 3.27.15

- goana() now loads the name spaces of GO.db and org.XX.eg.db instead
  of loading the packages.  This keeps the user search path cleaner.

22 March 2016: limma 3.27.14

- bug fix for Active Proportions from roast() when gene.weights are
  set.

 1 March 2016: limma 3.27.13

- update references to Phipson et al (2016) article on robust
  empirical Bayes.

11 February 2016: limma 3.27.12

- new argument 'save.plot' for voom().

- bug fix for kegga() when 'covariate' or 'prior.prob' are not NULL
  and when not all genes in the universe have annotation.

27 January 2016: limma 3.27.11

- kegga() now checks for missing values in 'gene.pathway' or
  'pathway.names'.

26 January 2016: limma 3.27.10

- kegga() gives better error message when there are no annotated genes
  in the universe.

- topKEGG() now breaks tied p-values by number of genes in pathway and
  by name of pathway.

- diffSplice() now returns genewise residual variances.

- plotRLDF() now uses squeezeVar() to estimate how by how much the
  within-group covariance matrix is moderated.  It has new arguments
  'trend' and 'robust' as options to the empirical Bayes estimation
  step.  It also has new argument 'var.prior' to allow the prior
  variances to be optionally supplied.  Argument 'df.prior' can now be
  a vector of genewise values.

11 Jan 2016: limma 3.27.9

- bug fix for kegga(), which wasn't passing the 'convert' argument
  to getGeneKEGGLinks().

 8 Jan 2016: limma 3.27.8

- goana() now supports species="Pt" (chimpanzee).

- kegga() has several new arguments and now supports any species
  supported by KEGG.  kegga() can now accept annotation as a
  data.frame, meaning that it can work from user-supplied annotation.

- new functions getGeneKEGGLinks() and getKEGGPathwayNames() to get
  pathway annotation from the rest.kegg website.

- removeExt() has new 'sep' argument.

29 Dec 2015: limma 3.27.7

- roast(), mroast(), fry() and camera() now require the 'design'
  matrix to be set.  Previously the design matrix defaulted to a
  single intercept column.

- Bug fix to plotRLDF(), to ensure 'top' is included in output object
  even if all the rows of data are used.

- gls.series() now gives a more informative error message when the
  correlation is equal to 1 or -1.

 1 Dec 2015: limma 3.27.6

- Slightly improved algorithm for producing the df2.shrunk values
  returned by fitFDistRobustly().  fitFDistRobustly() now returns
  tail.p.value, prob.outlier and df2.outlier as well as previously
  returned values.  The minimum df.prior value returned by
  eBayes(fit, robust=TRUE) may be slightly smaller than previously.

- update 'sort' argument of fry() to be the same as for mroast().

- edit help page for vennDiagram().

15 Nov 2015: limma 3.27.5

- update NEWS.Rd for Bioconductor 3.2 Release.

- plotRLDF() now produces more complete output and the output is
  more completely documented.  It can now be used as a complete LDF
  analysis for classification based on training data.  The argument
  'main' has been removed as an explicit argument because it and
  other plotting arguments are better passed using the ... facility.
  New arguments 'ndim' and 'plot' have been added.  The first allows
  all possible discriminant functions to be completed even if only
  two are plotted.  The second allows dicriminant functions to be
  computed without a plot.

- If a targets data.frame is provided to read.maimages() through the
  'files' argument, then read.maimages() now overwrites its rownames
  on output to agree with the column names of the RGList object.

 6 Nov 2015: limma 3.27.4

- Bug fix to tricubeMovingAverage() when length of series is even
  and span is close to 1.

30 Oct 2015: limma 3.27.3

- Add a check in camera() that dataset must contain as least three
  genes.

29 Oct 2015: limma 3.27.2

- Fix to NAMESPACE.  The function utils::winMenuAddItem(), which is
  needed to add a GUI menu item for the limma User's Guide, is now
  imported only conditionally in Windows.

27 Oct 2015: limma 3.27.1

- Functions needed from the grDevices, graphics, stats and utils
  packages are now imported explicitly into the NAMESPACE.

- Two changes to barcodeplot():  new argument 'alpha' to set
  semitransparency of positional bars in some circumstances;
  the default value for 'quantiles' is increased slightly.

- Bug fix to camera(), which was not accepting character values
  for index when weights were non-NULL.

- camera() now gives explicit error when too few residual df.

14 Oct 2015: limma 3.27.0 (Bioconductor 3.3 Developmental Branch)
14 Oct 2015: limma 3.26.0 (Bioconductor 3.2 Release Branch)

 7 Oct 2015: limma 3.25.18

- mroast() now sorts significant gene sets by proportion of genes
  changing as well as p-values and set size.  When p-values are 
  equal, sets with a higher proportion of changing genes will now
  rank higher in ordered results.

 6 Oct 2015: limma 3.25.17

- Checking for NA coefficients in lmFit() is now done more
  efficiently.

- bug fix for fry() when the gene set has a small number of genes.

- more informative error message from lmscFit() when correlation is
  NA.

19 Sep 2015: limma 3.25.16

- fry() now produces "mixed" (non-directional) p-values and FDRs as
  well as directional p-values and FDRs.

- tricubeMovingAverage() has new argument 'power' and old argument
  'full.length' is removed.
  
- tricubeMovingAverage() now checks whether span is correctly
  specified.  It now gives identical results for any span>=1 or any
  span<=0.

- the 'genes' argument of controlStatus() now accepts EListRaw or
  Elist objects.

- avearrays() now gives a more informative error message if input
  argument 'x' is not a matrix.

- getEAWP() now works on all eSet objects, not just ExpressionSet,
  provided there is an data element called "exprs".

 5 Aug 2015: limma 3.25.15

- argument truncate.term for topKEGG() renamed to 'truncate.path'.

20 July 2015: limma 3.25.14

- camera() has a new argument inter.gene.cor.  This allows a preset
  inter gene correlation to be set for each test test, resulting in
  potentially less conservative tests.

- All data classes (EListRaw, EList, RGList, MAList, MArrayLM) now 
  require two arguments for subsetting.  This restores the behavior
  in limma version 3.19.10 and earlier.  In limma 3.19.11 through
  3.25.13, subsetting by one argument y[i] was equivalent to y[i,].
  This will now give an error message.

- The contrast argument of roast() can now optionally be a character
  string giving the name of a column of the design matrix.

- lmFit() now treats infinite expression values as NA.  In the past,
  this was done somewhat inconsistently.

 7 July 2015: limma 3.25.13

- New 'tolerance' argument for read.idat() to allow manifest and idat
  to differ by a certain number of probes

- A minor change for when lmFit() is run on a single gene: a simple
  vector data 'object' is now coerced to a matrix with one row
  instead of one column  

26 June 2015: limma 3.25.12

- lmFit() and friends now always produce an output component 'rank'
  that returns the column rank of the design matrix.  Previously it
  depended on the options used whether this component was given.

23 June 2015: limma 3.25.11

- camera(), fry(), mroast() and romer() now give a more informative
  error message when the index list is empty.

- camera() no longer gives NA results when a gene has a residual
  variance exactly zero.

23 June 2015: limma 3.25.10

- bug fix to write.fit() when method="global" and fit contains more
  than one column.

 8 June 2015: limma 3.25.9

- plotMD() can now accept arguments 'array' or 'coef' as appropriate
  as synonyms for 'column'.  This may help users transitioning from
  plotMA ot plotMD.

 7 June 2015: limma 3.25.8

- Improved power for the romer() function.  The empirical Bayes
  shrinkage of the residuals, removed on 4 April, has been
  re-instated in a corrected form.  It can optionally be turned off
  using the 'shrink.resid' argument.

 5 June 2015: limma 3.25.7

- The dimnames<- method for EListRaw objects now sets rownames for
  the background matrix Eb as well as for the foreground matrix E.

 3 June 2015: limma 3.25.6

- new function kegga() to conduct KEGG pathway over-representation
  analyses.  kegga() is an S3 generic function with a method for
  MArrayLM fitted model objects.

20 May 2015: limma 3.25.5

- bug fix for plotWithHighlights(). Legend was not displaying
  correctly when there were no background points.

20 May 2015: limma 3.25.4

- goana() with trend now chooses the span of the tricube smoother
  based on the number of differentially expressed genes.  Larger
  spans give smoother trends and are used for smaller numbers of
  genes.  Arguments 'species' and 'plot' are no longer part of
  goana.MArrayLM() and are instead passed to goana.default().

- speedup for ids2indices().

- bug fix to plotMD.RGList.

28 April 2015: limma 3.25.3

- arguments hi.pch, hi.col and hi.cex of plotWithHighlights() renamed
  to hl.pch, hl.col and hl.cex.  ('hl' is short for 'highlight'.)

- fix bug in auROC() introduced in 3.25.2.

25 April 2015: limma 3.25.2

- arguments 'pch', 'col' and 'cex' of plotWithHighlights() renamed to
  'hi.pch', 'hi.col' and 'hi.cex'.  Improved help page for
  plotWithHighlights().

- plot() methods removed for EList, MAList and MArrayLM objects.
  Use plotMD() instead.

- genas() now gives an error message when applied to fitted model for
  which the coefficient correlations are gene-specific.

- topTable() now gives an information error message if eBayes() or
  treat() have not already been run on the fitted model object.

- NEWS.Rd updated for imminent Bioconductor 3.1 release.

8 April 2015: limma 3.23.13

- new function fry(), which provides a fast version of mroast()
  when there is little heteroscedasticity between genes.
 
- minor change to mroast() output so that FDR values are never
  smaller than p-values when midp=TRUE.
 
 4 April 2015: limma 3.23.12

- camera(), roast(), mroast() and romer() now give a warning if
  any arguments found in ... are not used.

- In the romer() function, the empirical Bayes shrinkage of the
  residuals, introduced 5 October 2009, has been removed.  The
  results will revert to being somewhat more conservative.

- speed improvement for romer() when the "mean" or "floormean" set
  statistics are used.

- topGO() can now sort gene ontology results by several p-value
  columns at once, using the minimum of the columns.  The default is
  now to sort results using all the p-value columns found in the
  results instead of just by the first column.

- new arguments 'plot' and 'covariate' for goana().  The help files
  goana.Rd and goana.MArrayLM.Rd are consolidated into one file.

13 March 2015: limma 3.23.11

- new argument 'legend' for plotDensities, allowing user to
  reposition the legend.

  'prop.true.null.method' passes through method to propTrueNull.

25 Nov 2014: limma 3.23.2

- plotMDS() now stores 'axislabel', depending on the method used to
  compute distances, and using this for axis labels.

- vennDiagram now fills circles with specified colors.

- voomWithQualityWeights() now stores the sample weights in the
  sample.weights component output EList objects.  The values stored
  in $weights are unchanged, they are still the combined 
  observation and sample weights.

  set correctly for source="agilent.mean" or source="agilent.median".

18 Aug 2014: limma 3.21.13

- Speed improvement for the calculation of Simes adjusted p-values by
  diffSplice().

- argument 'level' for diffSplice() renamed to 'test', with possible
  values "simes", "F" or "t".

 8 Aug 2014: limma 3.21.12

- The definition of the M and A axes for an MA-plot of single channel
  data is changed slightly.  Previously the A-axis was the average of
  all arrays in the dataset -- this has been definition since MA-plots
  were introduced for single channel data in April 2003.  Now an
  artificial array is formed by averaging all arrays other than the
  one to be plotted.  Then a mean-difference plot is formed from the
  specified array and the artificial array.  This change ensures the 
  specified and artificial arrays are computed from independent data,
  and ensures the MA-plot will reduce to a correct mean-difference
  plot when there are just two arrays in the dataset.

 7 Aug 2014: limma 3.21.11

- diffSplice() now includes Simes adjusted p-values

- topSplice() has a new level="hybrid" argument for ranking genes by
  Simes adjusted p-values.

- goana() is now an S3 generic function.

- goana() can now optionally adjust for gene length or abundance
  bias.

27 June 2014: limma 3.21.10

- remove col argument from plotMDS(), as it handled by ... as are
  other graphics arguments.

- vennDiagram() now supports circles of different colors for any
  number of circles.  Previously this was supported only up to three
  sets.  

23 June 2014: limma 3.21.9

- new function goana() for gene ontology analysis of DE results from
  a linear model fit.

- symbols2indices() renamed to ids2indices().

- update to helpMethods().

- keyword entries revised for many Rd files.

- bug fix to topTableF() and topTable() ordering of Amean values when
  ranking is by F-statistic and a lfc or p.value filter has been set.

18 June 2014: limma 3.21.8

- improvements to roast() and mroast().  The directional (up and
  down) tests done by roast() now use both the original rotations
  and their opposite signs, effectively doubling the number of
  effective rotations.  The two-sided tests are now done explicitly
  by rotation instead of doubling the smallest one-sided p-value.
  The two-sided p-value is now called "UpOrDown" in the roast()
  output.

16 June 2014: limma 3.21.7

- bug fix to read.ilmn() when sep=",".

- biocViews keywords updated.

 3 June 2014: limma 3.21.6

- roast() and mroast() have a new argument 'approx.zscore'.  By
  default they now use approx=TRUE when calling zscoreT().

- zscoreT() can now optionally use a fast approximation instead of
  the slower exact calculation.

- plotMDS() can now optionally plot samples using symbols instead of
  text labels.

- many Rd files have been reformated to avoid over long lines in the
  pdf manual.

 1 June 2014: limma 3.21.5

- Further change to removeBatchEffect(), which now calls lmFit() to
  estimate the batch effect.  This means that removeBatchEffect() can
  now take into account weights and other arguments that will affect
  the linear model fit.  This also corrects a problem, introduced by
  the previous change, when the batch effect was confounded with the
  design matrix.

20 May 2014: limma 3.21.4

- Change to removeBatchEffect() when there is a non-trivial design
  matrix.  Previously batch adjustments were made only within the
  treatment levels defined by the design matrix.  The behavior of
  removeBatchEffect() is now more consistent that of linear modelling
  with lmFit() with batches as additive effects.

19 May 2014: limma 3.21.3

- Remove unnecessary call to eBayes() from topTable when ranking by
  F-statistic for a subset of the coefficients.

13 May 2014: limma 3.21.2

- Subsetting columns of a MArrayLM object should not subset the
  design matrix.  Now fixed.

12 April 2014: limma 3.21.1

- Update to Pasilla case study in User's Guide.

12 April 2014: limma 3.21.0 (Bioconductor 2.15 Developmental Branch)
12 April 2014: limma 3.20.0 (Bioconductor 2.14 Release Branch)

 7 April 2014: limma 3.19.30

- Update to Pasilla case study in User's Guide.

30 March 2014: limma 3.19.29

- duplicateCorrelation() now traps errors arising from mixedModel2()
  or La.svd().  Rows that produce errors are assigned an NA
  correlation which does not contribute to the consensus value.

21 March 2014: limma 3.19.28

- updating NEWS.Rd ready for Bioconductor 2.14 release.

21 March 2014: limma 3.19.27

- new function read.idat() to read files from Illumina expression
  beadarrays in IDAT format.

- new plot() methods for RGList, MAList, EList and MArrayLM class
  objects.  In each case, produces similar result to plotMA().

- the array argument of plotMA.MArrayLM has been renamed to coef, and
  the default is changed from 1 to ncol(MA).

21 March 2014: limma 3.19.26

- Updates to help pages.  The topic page 10Other.Rd is deleted.
  The topic pages GeneSetTesting.Rd and RNAseq.Rd renamed to
  10GeneSetTests.Rd and 11RNAseq.Rd and their content is expanded.
  The example for weightedLowess.Rd is revised to take less time.

20 March 2014: limma 3.19.25

- improvements to plotSplice(), which now highlights signficant exons
  and plots exon position annotation.

- New Pasilla case study added to User's Guide, demonstrating
  differential splicing analysis of RNA-seq data.

- New topic help pages for Gene Set Testing and RNA-seq analysis.
  The topic pages are now linked from the package introduction page
  accessible by ?limma.

15 March 2014: limma 3.19.24

- new functions diffSplice(), topSplice() and plotSplice() to detect
  differentially spliced genes from exon-level expression data.

5 March 2014: limma 3.19.23

- biocViews updated in DESCRIPTION file.

28 February 2014: limma 3.19.22

- topTreat() now includes ... argument which is passed to topTable().

- camera(), roast() and mroast() restored as S3 generic functions
  with a default method only.

27 February 2014: limma 3.19.21

- camera(), roast() and mroast() now use getEAWP() to interpret the 
  data object.  This means that they now work on any class of data
  object that lmFit() will.  They are no longer generic functions.

- topTable() with confint=TRUE now produces confidence intervals
  based on the t-distribution instead of on the normal distribution.
  It also now accepts a numeric value for the confint argument to 
  specify a confidence level other the default of 0.95.

21 February 2014: limma 3.19.20

- Bug fix: fitFDistRobustly() was failing when there were missing
  values or zero df values and covariate was NULL.

18 February 2014: limma 3.19.19

- new function tricubeMovingAverage() for smoothing a time series.

- The enrichment worms shown by barcodeplot() now use
  tricubeMovingAverage().  This makes the worms much smoother than
  previously.

- plotMA3by2() now accepts single channel data objects as well as
  two color.

- Bug fix: the mroast methods for EList and MAList objects were
  ignoring the midp, p.adjust and sorting arguments.

11 February 2014: limma 3.19.18

- The new subsetting code of 13 Dec 2013 introduced a bug whereby
  MArrayLM objects couldn't be subsetted by column name.  Now fixed.

 5 February 2014: limma 3.19.17

- The change to read.ilmn() in 3.19.16 caused an error when the
  Illumina probe IDs were not all unique.  The probe IDs are now used
  as row.names for the annotation data.frame only when they are
  unique.

31 January 2014: limma 3.19.16

- treat() now has new arguments robust and winsor.tail.p which are
  passed through to robust empirical Bayes estimation.

- barcodeplot() has a new option to add enrichment worms to the plot.

- vennDiagram() wasn't passing extra arguments (...) to plot() when
  the number of sets was greater than 3.  Now fixed.

- read.ilmn() now sets the same probe IDs as rownames for both the 
  expression matrix E and the annotation data.frame genes.

- beadCountWeights() can now work with either probe-wise standard
  errors or probe-wise standard deviations.

- new function weightedLoess() which fits a lowess curve with
  prior weights.  Unlike previous implementations of lowess or loess,
  the weights are used in calculating which neighbouring points to
  include in each local regression as well as in the local
  regression itself.

- weightedLoess() now becomes the default method used by loessFit()
  to fit the loess curve when there are weights.  The previous locfit
  and loess() methods are offered as options.

14 Jan 2014: limma 3.19.15

- romer() now uses propTrueNull(method="lfdr") instead of convest().
  This makes romer() substantially faster when the number of genes
  is large.

11 Jan 2014: limma 3.19.14

- update citation of Law et al (2014) reference for voom().

- roast() and mroast() now permit array weights and observation
  weights to both be specified.

- bug fix to mroast() which was not accepting array.weights.

17 Dec 2013: limma 3.19.13

- make sure that F is recomputed when the columns of an MArrayLM
  are subsetted.

12 Dec 2013: limma 3.19.12

- linear model fit functions lm.series(), mrlm.series() and
  gls.series() no longer drop the dimensions of the components of
  the fitted object when there is just coefficient or just one gene.
  Previously this was done inconsistently in some cases but not
  others.  Now the matrix components always keep dimensions.

11 Dec 2013: limma 3.19.11

- New function subsetListOfArrays(), which is used to simplify the
  subsetting code for RGList, MAList, EList, EListRaw and MArrayLM
  objects.

 7 Dec 2013: limma 3.19.10

- Bug fix to topTreat().  Rownames were incorrectly ordered when p<1.

- topTable() will now work on an MArrayLM fit object that is missing
  the lods component, for example as produced by treat().

 6 Dec 2013: limma 3.19.9

- Fix to tmixture.vector() to allow it work even with just one gene.
  This allows the eBayes() to work on fit objects with just one row.

 3 Dec 2013: limma 3.19.8

- lmFit() now works even when there is only one gene (one row of
  data).

 2 Dec 2013: limma 3.19.7

- bug fix to genas(), which was not handling vector df.prior
  correctly when the fit object was generated using robust=TRUE.

- genas() now uses fit$df.total from the MArrayLM object.  This 
  prevents df.total from exceeding the total pooled residual df
  for the dataset.  The genas() results will change slightly for
  datasets for which df.prior was very lage.

- bug fix to squeezeVar().  Previously there was an error when
  robust=TRUE and trend=FALSE and some of the estimated df.prior
  were infinite.

- The ctrlpath argument of read.ilmn() now defaults to the same as
  path for regular probes.  This means that only one path setting
  is required if the regular and control probe profiles are in the
  same directory.

- avereps() was never intended to be applied to RGList or EListRaw
  objects.  It now gives an error when applied to these objects
  instead of returning a matrix of questionable value.

18 Nov 2013: limma 3.19.6

- plotDensities() is now an S3 generic function with methods for
  RGList, MAList, EListRaw and EList objects.

13 Nov 2013: limma 3.19.5

- NAMESPACE now exports plotFB methods.

- bug fix to x-axis label for some plotMA methods.

13 Nov 2013: limma 3.19.4

- plotFB now an S3 generic function with methods for RGList and EList
  data objects.

10 Nov 2013: limma 3.19.3

- edits to help pages for read.ilmn, neqc, beadCountWeights, voom and
  vooma.

 4 Nov 2013: limma 3.19.2

- bug fix to topTable() and topTableF() when sorting by F-statistic
  combined with p-value or lfc cutoffs.

- Improved error message from loessFit() when locfit package is
  needed but not available.

29 Sept 2013: limma 3.17.25

- loessFit() now uses the locfit.raw in the locfit package when
  weights are provided instead of loess in the stats package.  The
  function now runs very efficiently even on very long data vectors.
  The output results will change slightly when weights are provided.

- Roles of contributors now specified in author field of DESCRIPTION
  file using standard codes.

- Bug fix to subsetting for MArrayLM objects: the df.total component
  was not being subsetted.

- roast() now calls mroast() if the index vector is a list.

- Bug fix to mroast(), which had been ignoring the weights.

1 Sept 2013: limma 3.17.23

- New function contrastAsCoef(), which reforms a design matrix so
  that one or more specified contrasts become coefficients.  This
  function is called by roast().

  set.  Previously the weights were ignored when block was used.

26 July 2013: limma 3.17.19

- genas() now returns NA results and a message when no genes satisfy
  the criterion for inclusion in the analysis.

26 July 2013: limma 3.17.18

- argument chooseMethod for genas() renamed to subset.  Option "n"
  renamed to "all".  Some editing of help page and streamlining of
  code for genas().

21 July 2013: limma 3.17.17

- edits to normalizeBetweenArrays help page (i) to further clarify
  which normalization methods are available for single-channel data
  and which are available for two-color data and (ii) to give a cross
  citation to the neqc() function for Illumina BeadChips.

26 June 2013: limma 3.17.16

- bug fix to eBayes(robust=TRUE) when some of the df.prior values are
  infinite.

 5 June 2013: limma 3.17.15

- new function beadCountWeights() to estimate quantitative weights
  from the bead counts for each probe for Illumina BeadArrays.

- voom() now outputs lib.size as a column of targets instead of as a
  separate component.

- cbind for EList and EListRaw objects now recognizes a design matrix
  if it is present.

- plotMDS() now checks explicitly that there are at least 3 samples
  to plot.

27 May 2013: limma 3.17.14

- normexp.fit.detection.p() now tolerates some non-monotonicity in
  the detection p-pvalues as a function of expression.

27 May 2013: limma 3.17.13

- New merge methods for EList and EListRaw objects.

 5 May 2013: limma 3.17.10
 
- read.ilmn() no longer adds the probe IDs to the gene annotation
  data.frame, leaving them instead as rownames of the expression
  matrix.  It longer creates a targets file since the sample names
  are already preserved as column names of the expression matrix.

- Update mammmary stem cell case study in User's Guide.  As well
  as reflecting changes to read.ilmn() and topTable(), this now
  demonstrates how to find signature genes for particular cell type.

 1 May 2013: limma 3.17.9

- Bug fix to ebayes(), which was not passing the 'robust' argument
  correctly on to squeezeVar().

- Update of mammary stem cell case study in User's Guide.

25 April 2013: limma 3.17.8

- Bug fix to fitFDistRobustly(), which affected the estimated scale
  when df2 is estimated to be Inf.

23 April 2013: limma 3.17.7

- Update Estrogen case study in User's Guide to reflect change in
  rownames of topTable output.

- Update Nigerian RNA-seq case study in User's Guide, adding new
  MA-plot.

- Further fixes to toptable(), topTableF() and topTreat() to
  implement the changes begun in 3.17.5.

- documentation about rownames and column names and the use of
  rownames(fit) and colnames(fit) added to lmFit.Rd.

20 April 2013: limma 3.17.5

- Reverting most of change to getEAWP() in version 3.17.3.  getEAWP()
  now simply preserves the rownames found in object, specifically
  those found in the expression matrix.  Null rownames are left null,
  unless the probe annotation data.frame has row.names, in which case
  these are used.

- toptable(), topTable() and topTreat() now preserve the rownames of
  the fit object, unless the fit object has duplicated names, in
  which case the rownames are copied to the ID column.  Empty
  rownames are replaced with 1:nrow(fit).

15 April 2013: limma 3.17.4

- toptable() and topTable() now preserve rownames of fit object in
  the rownames of the toptable.

15 April 2013: limma 3.17.3

- getEAWP() now forces the output exprs matrix to have unique row
  names.

- fitFDistRobustly() now uses a smoother for the smallest df.prior
  values.  This may result in smaller tail values than before when
  a group of input x values appear to be outliers but the largest
  value is not individually a stand-out value.

10 April 2013: limma 3.17.2

- improvements to help pages for data classes.

 7 April 2013: limma 3.17.1

- topTable() and treat() now give more informative error messages
  when the argument fit is not a valid MArrayLM object.

 4 April 2013: limma 3.17.0 (Bioconductor 2.13 Developmental Branch)
 4 April 2013: limma 3.16.0 (Bioconductor 2.12 Release Branch)

31 March 2013: limma 3.15.21

  largest statistic is not greater than the non-robust df.prior.

- edit acknowledgements in User's Guide.

30 March 2013: limma 3.15.20

- final edits to NEWS.Rd and other help pages before BioC 2.12 release.

- revise Nigerian RNA-seq case study in User's Guide.

- bug fix to lmscFit() when the residual df = 1.

- update NEWS.Rd for Bioc release 2.12.

- add Phipson (2013) reference to genas.Rd and predFCm.Rd.

- add Law (2013) reference to voom.Rd and vooma.Rd.

- normalizeWithinArrays() with method="robustspline" now longer
  requires the layout argument to be set.

16 March 2013: limma 3.15.17

- bug fix to vennDiagram(), which was not restoring the graphics
  par() settings correctly on exit.

16 March 2013: limma 3.15.16

- bug fix to read.maimages().  Previously was not setting default
  annotation columns for source="agilent.mean".

10 March 2013: limma 3.15.15

- new function voomaByGroup(), similar to vooma() but with different
  variances for different groups.

- vennDiagram() can now plot up to five sets (previously limited to
  three).

- mroast() now outputs number of genes in each set.

- new option method="mean" for propTrueNULL().

- bug fix for fitFDistRobustly with trend=FALSE and robust=TRUE.

4 Feb 2013: limma 3.15.14

- To make the interfaces more consistent, all functions that perform
  gene sets now use the argument 'index' to specify which genes 
  are included in the test set.  Previously this argument was called
  'iset' for roast() and romer() and 'indices' for camera().

- When sorting results, mroast() now tries to break ties more
  sensibly rather than keeping original order.

- section on time course experiments with many time points added to
  User's Guide.

24 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.13

- documentation added for fitGammaIntercept().

- bug fix to readTargets() to avoid warning message when
  targets$Label is used to set row names but targets$Label
  contains duplicated entries.

16 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.12

- bug fix to read.maimages(), which was not accepting
  source="agilent.mean".

8 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.11

- New function predFCm() to compute predictive (shrunk) log
  fold changes.

- updating help pages for genas().

8 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.10

- mroast() now an S3 generic function, with methods for EList and
  MAList objects.

- mroast() has a new argument 'weights' for observational weights,
  to bring it into line with roast().

4 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.9

- mroast() now produces a data.frame instead of a list of matrices.
  It also has a new argument 'sort' to indicate whether and how the
  output results should be sorted by p-value.

- roast.Rd now cross-links to the camera help page instead of to
  geneSetTest.

4 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.8

- camera() now produces a data.frame instead of a matrix, and with
  different columns than previously.  Instead of separate up and down
  p-value columns there is now a column indicating direction of
  change.  A new column gives the FDR adjusted p-value.

- camera() has a new argument 'sort' to indicate whether output
  results should be sorted by p-value.

4 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.7

- camera() is now an S3 generic function, with methods for EList and
  MAList objects.

- Order of arguments changed for camera().  First argument is now y.

4 Jan 2013: limma 3.15.6

- roast() is now an S3 generic function, with methods for EList and
  MAList objects.

- Order of arguments changed for roast() and mroast().  First
  argument is now y.

29 Nov 2012: limma 3.15.5

- New robust method for estimating the empirical Bayes prior, called
  by specifying robust=TRUE in the call to eBayes().  When this is
  TRUE the output df.prior is now a vector instead of a scalar.
  
- New function fitFDistRobustly() estimates the parameters of a
  scaled F-distribution robustly using Winsorized values.  Outlier
  observations receive smaller values for df.prior than non-outliers.
  This permits robust methods for squeezeVar(), ebayes() and eBayes(),
  all of which now have a new argument wins.tail.p to specify the
  tail proportions for Winsorizing.

- fitFDist() now permits infinite values for covariate.  It also
  gracefully handles cases where the covariate takes only a small
  number of distinct values.  Similarly for eBayes() and squeezeVar()
  that call fitFDist().  

- new function vooma() for computing precision weights based on a
  mean-variance trend.  This is similar to voom() but for microarray
  data instead of RNA-Seq.

- genas() now has the ability to automatically select which probes
  are used for the correlation analysis.  A new argument controls the
  method used for this selection.

- genas() now optionally draws a plot in which ellipses are used to
  represent the technical and biological components of correlation.

- new function fitGammaIntercept() for estimating the intercept of
  a gamma glm with an offset.  (No .Rd file at present.)

- new function propTrueNull() for estimating the proportion of true
  null hypotheses from a vector of p-values.

- new function zscoreHyper() for computing z-score equivalents of
  deviates from a hypergeometric distribution.

- The layout argument for normalizeRobustSpline() now defaults to a
  single print-tip group.

- Additional motivating comments added to normalizeRobustSpline.Rd.

13 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.4

- new function qqf() for qq-plots relative to an F-distribution.

- minor help page improvements for squeezeVar(), fitFDist() and
  trigammaInverse().

13 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.3

- Rewrite details section of read.maimages.Rd for extra clarity and
  to fix a typo concerning the meaning of source="agilent".

- Bug fix for contrasts.fit() when the covariance matrix of the 
  coefficients (cov.coefficients) is not found in the fitted model
  object.  This situation doesn't arise using any of the standard
  limma analysis pipelines.

 8 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.2

- Due to changes in R-devel, loessFit() no longer makes direct calls
  to foreign language code in the stats package, and instead calls R
  functions.  This makes loessFit() about 25-30% slower when weights
  are used.

 4 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.1

- fitFDist() now coerces degrees of freedom df1 below 1e-15 to zero.

 2 Oct 2012: limma 3.15.0 (Bioconductor 2.12 Developmental Branch)
 2 Oct 2012: limma 3.14.0 (Bioconductor 2.11 Release Branch)

 1 Oct 2012: limma 3.13.25

- Two bug fixes for roast() when there are observational weights.

27 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.24

- roast() now accepts observation level weights, through a new
  argument 'weights'.

27 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.23

- Update NEWS.Rd ready for Bioconductor 2.11 release.

26 Sep 2012: limma 3.13.22

- fitFDist() now permits missing values for x or zero values for df1
  with a non-null covariate.  This means that squeezeVar() and

  automatically subsetted for each gene set.

5 Jan 2012: limma 3.11.6

- new methods "fast" and "affy" for normalizeCyclicLoess().  New
  argument 'cyclic.method' for normalizeBetweenArrays() gives

- remove line from NAMESPACE requiring methods on loading.

27 November 2010: limma 3.7.11

- bug fix to mroast(), which had been assigning prior.df
  incorrectly for the second and subsequent gene sets.

3 November 2010: limma 3.7.10

- the total df used by ebayes to compute p-values (and therefore
  also by eBayes, topTable and so on) is now not allowed to be
  larger than the total residual df pooled over all probes.
  This limit will normally become active only when the prior df
  is estimated as Inf.  Previously the total df was also allowed
  to be Inf in this case, so that p-values were computed as if
  the t-statistics followed a standard normal distibution.  This
  change will not affect microarray analyses with thousands of
  genes, but can come into play with simulated data or with
  data sets with only a few genes or probes.  In these cases,
  the ebayes p-values now agree with those from a pooled analysis
  in which the genewise variances are assumed equal.

- df.total is now included as a component of the MArrayLM object
  output by ebayes() and eBayes().

- ebayes() and eBayes() now include an option to allow the prior
  variance to be intensity-dependent.  Associated with this is a
  new optional argument 'covariate' to functions fitFDist() and
  squeezeVar().

  function is changed to "Detection". 

26 October 2010: limma 3.7.6

- .read.oneilmnfile() and read.ilmn() are now careful to return
  the genes annotation as a data.frame, not a character vector,
  even when it only has one column.

26 October 2010: limma 3.7.5

- rbind.EList and rbind.EListRaw now behave correctly when one
  or more of the matrix components are simply undimensioned
  vectors.

26 October 2010: limma 3.7.4

- bug fix to rbind.EListRaw and rbind.EList.  This bug also

  visible, except that background intensities are now
  used correctly when the argument RG is an EListRaw object.

5 October 2009: limma 3.0.0

- New function genas() which tests for associations between
  contrasts in a linear model.

- New options and improved power for the romer() function.  Empirical
  Bayes shrinkage of the residuals is now used to improve statistical
  power.  There are also two new options for the set summary
  statistic.  The original mean50 statistic is now provided in a new
  function romer2().  The new romer() function now uses an ordinary
  mean set statistics by default, and a floor-mean set statistic as
  an option.  Both romer() and romer2() give better statistical power
  than than the previous version.  The new romer() is also
  computationally quicker.

- new functions read.ilmn() and read.ilmn.targets() for reading in
  Illumina Whole Genome Expression BeadChip data.

- new functions normexp.fit.control() and neqc() which perform
  normexp background correction using negative control information.
  This is especially useful for Illumina BeadChip data.  neqc()
  undertakes background correction and quantile normalization in
  one step for EListRaw data objects with negative control probes.

- new function propexpr() for estimating the proportion of
  expressed probes in a microarray, using negative control probe
  information.  Especially useful for Illumina BeadChip data.

- new function barcodeplot2() for displaying directional gene sets
  with up and down genes shown separately.

- removed sma from list of suggested packages

- Barnard (1963) reference added to roast.Rd.
- rewording of details in romer.Rd.
- two fixes to contrasts.fit() when there are non-estimable
  coefficients in the linear model.  The function previously
  gave a warning about coercing double to logical, which no
  longer appears.  The function also failed in this situation
  when the contrast was a single vector instead of a matrix.
- convergence criterion for arrayWeightsSimple() is now more
  lenient for large data sets.  About 5 decimal place accuracy
  is still achieved.
- arrayWeightsSimple() now checks for failed convergence
  from floating point errors and returns a diagnostic message.
- getEAWP() and lmFit() now return Amean values for EList
  objects.
- calculation of rotation p-values in roast() and romer()
  changed to be (x+1)/(nrot+1) instead of x/nrot, where x is
  the number of random rotations giving a more extreme statistic
  than that observed.

- bug fix to printHead() to handle object components which
  are neither atomic nor recursive.

13 April 2009: limma 2.17.19

- ebayes() now returns lods as a matrix.  This ensures that
  MArrayLM objects always be subsetted by column names, even
  when there is only one column.
- new argument channels for read.maimages(), which allows the
  function to read one-channel data.
- new class EListRaw for non-normalized one-channel data.

- correction to the "bic" method of selectModel().

28 Sept 2008: limma 2.15.13

- more efficient memory management in normexp.c (not user-visible)
- argument bg removed from internal functions .normexp.m2loglik,
  .normexp.gm2loglik and .normexp.hm2loglik (not user-visible)

25 Sept 2008: limma 2.15.12

- substantial tidying up of normexp.fit() code, although very little
  of this will be visible to users.  The old pure-R normexp.fit() is
  removed and replaced by the function previously called
  normexp.fit.C().  The old method "neldermead" is now replaced by
  "saddle".  The old methods "bfgs", "nlminb" and "nlminblog" now
  replaced by "mle".
- all user-visible functions previously called by normexp.fit()
  are now removed including: dnormexp(), dnormexp.saddle(),
  normexp.m2loglik() and normexp.m2loglik.saddle().  There are
  now just 4 utility functions, none of which are exported from the
  limma NAMESPACE, namely .normexp.m2loglik, .normexp.gm2loglik,
  .normexp.hm2loglik and .bg.parameters.rma75.
- More comments added to C code supporting normexp.fit().  The
  source code file is renamed from find_saddle_theta2.c to
  normexp.c.
- backgroundCorrect() has a new argument normexp.method to
  specify the parametrization estimation method when for normexp
  background correction.  The options are "mle", "saddle",
  "rma" and "rma75".
- in read.maimages(), support added for ArrayVision data files
  with 'Artifact-removed' (ARM) density values.
- new function selectModel() which implements Akaike Information
  Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion model (BIC)
  selection between alternative linear models.
- new function alias2Symbol() to convert gene aliases to
  official symbols.  Uses the data packages org.Hs.eg.db etc.
- new arguments sort.by and p.value for topTableF().  This makes
  it more consistent with topTable().
- topTableF() now allows the input argument number to be larger
  than the number of rows of the fitted model object.  In this
  case the requested number is set to the number of available
  rows.
- non user-visible improvements to toptable() code.

21 August 2008: limma 2.15.11

- new option "none" for the sort argument of topTable().
- new function roast() which does rotation gene set testing for
  linear models.
- new function treat() which computes empirical Bayes moderated-t
  p-values relative to a minimum required fold change threshold.
- new function removeBatchEffects() which removes batch effects
  from microarray data.
- tableF() now gives a friendlier error message when the fitted
  model object doesn't contain F-statistics.

11 July 2008: limma 2.15.10

- Better treatment of array weights in linear modelling.
  lm.series() and gls.series() now treat array weights as a
  special case, when there are no missing values in the expression
  data and now probe-specific weights.  This means that the array
  weights are now incorporated into fit$cov.coefficients, meaning
  that contrasts.fit() will correctly take array weights into
  account when computing the contrast standard errors, which it
  did not do previously.  It also means that lmFit() is much faster
  when array weighting is used.
- Speed improvement to gls.series() when there are no missing
  values and no probe-specific weights.

16 June 2008: limma 2.15.9

- new capabilities and arguments for write.fit().  The argument
  method allows p-values to be adjusted globally instead of
  separately, and the argument F.adjust allows the F-statistic
  P-values to be adjusted.

11 June 2008: limma 2.15.8

- further bug fixes to getEAWP() when object is of PLMset class:
  weights and Amean components were not being set.

4 June 2008: limma 2.15.7

- new S3 generic function avereps() for averaging over irregularly
  spaced replicate spots.  A method is defined for MAList objects
  and a default method intended for matrices.

1 June 2008: limma 2.15.6

- gls.series() now preserves rownames (probe IDs) of the expression
  object.  This affects lmFit() when ndups>1 or block is non NULL.
  This makes gls.series() consistent with other fitting functions
  lm.series() and mrlm().

22 May 2008: limma 2.15.5

- fix bug introduced to plotMA() in version 2.13.6: plotMA()
  ignored array argument when object was of class RGList.
  Correct function now restored.

20 May 2008: limma 2.15.4

- Cleaning up of source code in find_saddle_theta2.c and
  corresponding calls in background-normexp-mle.R.  No user
  visible changes.  The C code now passes R CMD check without
  warnings, and superfluous utility functions are removed from
  background-normexp-mle.R

12 May 2008: limma 2.15.3

- The optimisation step of normexp.fit is now done in C, making
  a new function normexp.fit.C, speeding up the computation several
  fold.  normexp.fit.C() has two new methods available "nlminb"
  and "nlminblog" which compute maximum likelihood estimates.
  backgroundCorrect(method="normexp") now calls normexp.fit.C()
  with method="saddle".

8 May 2008: limma 2.15.2

- the following obsolete functions (deprecated Dec 2006 in favour
  of read.maimages) are now removed: m.spot, a.spot, read.matrix,
  read.series, rg.series.spot, rg.genepix, rg.quantarray, rg.spot

8 May 2008: limma 2.15.1

- fix bug introduced to plotMA() in version 2.13.6: plotMA()

- getEAWP() now gets probe names correctly from the rownames of
  exprs when object is of PLMset class.
- edits to read.columns help page to explain that some arguments
  cannot be passed to read.table through ... because they are
  already used by read.columns.

30 April 2008: limma 2.15.0 (Bioconductor 2.3 Branch)
25 April 2008: limma 2.13.10

- getEAWP() now gets probe names correctly from the rownames of 
  object when object is a matrix.

24 April 2008: limma 2.13.9

- normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") now gives an error
  if object is an MAList.
- normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") now uses vsnMatrix()
  when the data object is a matrix.

16 April 2008: limma 2.13.8

- bug fix to normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn").  When the
  function was updated on 14 December 2007 to use vsnMatrix,
  it had not been noticed that vsnMatrix returns log2 results
  whereas the older vsn function returned loge results.  The
  results returned by normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") are
  again now log2, similar to before 14 December 2007.
- method option "neldermean" for normexp.fit() corrected
  to "neldermead"
- deprecated function splitName() removed
- the help page for backgroundCorrect edited for improved
  readability

26 March 2008: limma 2.13.7

- the function rlm.series(), deprecated in 2004, is now removed
- add comments in the geneSetTest help file to warn that the
  test assumes genewise independence. 

8 March 2008: limma 2.13.6

- Streamlining of plotMA() code.  plotMA() should now work correctly
  for any object class that can be coerced to a matrix, for example
  LumiBatch objects.
- lmFit() now warns if coefficients become inestimable due to
  missing values.
- Bug fix when matrix data object passed to lmFit() containing
  missing values.  The check for log-intensities vs log-ratios
  introduced 27 Oct 2007 did not remove missing values and
  hence produced an error.
- New function getEAWP() introduced to unify the treatment of
  different classes of microarray data objects as input to linear
  model functions such as lmFit(), arrayWeights() and
  printtipWeights().
- Class exprSet2 removed.

27 February 2008: limma 2.13.5

- All usage of Biobase's exprSet class removed or replaced with
  ExpressionSet.
- Fortran call in .vsimpleLoess() function updated.

13 February 2008: limma 2.13.4

- all uses of I() in data.frame() arguments removed and replaced
  with stringsAsFactors=FALSE.  This ensures that the appropriate
  columns in data.frames will have class "character" instead of
  "AsIs".
- arrayWeights() now gives nice error message if the number of
  arrays is too few to give statistically useful results.

2 January 2008: limma 2.13.3

- Section on Mutiple Testing Across Contrasts added to the 
  User's Guide.
- The bibTeX entry returned by citation("limma") now uses
  @incollection styole instead of @inbook, thanks to Joern Toedling.

14 December 2007: limma 2.13.2

- update normalizeBetweenArrays(method="vsn") to reflect
  changes in the vsn package version 3.4.1.
- additions to the help file for MArrayLM-class objects

27 October 2007: limma 2.13.1

- lmFit() now tries to guess whether a data matrix contains log-ratios
  or log-intensities.
  When the input data object is a matrix, it is not possible to know
  for certain whether the data are log-ratios or log-intensities, and
  so lmFit() did not set the component Amean in the MArrayLM output
  object.  lmFit() now sets Amean if the input data values are all
  positive, because the data are almost certainly log-ratios in that
  case.

8 October 2007:

  users to cut the gene list on adjusted p.value and fold change, rather
  than just taking a set number of genes as before.

22 July 2007: limma 2.11.9

- improvements to the numeric computations of dnormexp.saddle(), which
  is used by backgroundCorrect(method="normexp")

  normexp.m2loglik() but using the saddle-point approximation.
- normexp.fit() has a new argument 'methods'
- default for n.pts in normexp.fit() changed to NULL, meaning use all
  the points.  The rule used to choose the quantiles if n.pts is
  improved to give more nearly unbiased parameter estimators.

9 July 2007: limma 2.11.8

- contrasts.fit() now warns if row names of contrast matrix don't
  match column names of contrasts.
- plotMA3by2 has a new argument 'device' to specify the graphic format.

24 June 2007: limma 2.11.7

- decideTests(method="hierarchical") now passes the adjust.method down
  to the second (t-test) level of testing.  Previously the second level
  testing was always "holm".  The spelling is also corrected from
  "heirarchical" to "hierarchical".

8 June 2007: limma 2.11.6

- new argument n.pts for normexp.fit.  n.pts=2^10 becomes the default
  for method="normexp" in backgroundCorrect().  This decreases
  computation time and introduces some robustness.
- backgroundCorrect() now accepts a matrix argument.

30 May 2007: limma 2.10.5 and 2.11.5

- as.matrix method for vsn objects added.

  and resort.by="AveExpr" are now allowed.

26 Mar 2007: limma 2.9.15

- bug fix to read.columns, to read SPOT files with a leading column
  of row numbers. Was failing because the number of headers was
  less than the number of columns.

10 Mar 2007: limma 2.9.14

- lmFit() was giving error with marrayNorm object, because of
  incorrect setting of Amean. Fixed.

24 Feb 2007: limma 2.9.13

  t-statistic and p-value when the MArrayLM object had only one
  column and these components were matrices with one named column.
  Now fixed.
- default changed in write.fit() to digits=3.

22 Feb 2007: limma 2.9.12

- lm.series() gls.series() were returning errors when the design
  matrix was not of full rank and the columns were names.  Bug fixed.

PRE-HISTORY

The limma package was originally called the smawehi package, which was
made public for the first time as SMAWEHI Version 0.1 for the One Day
Course "Statistics for Microarray Data Analysis" at the Australian
Genstat Conference, Perth, Australia, 2 December 2002.  Presenters
were Terry Speed, Gordon Smyth and Natalie Thorne.  The package was
served from an R repository at http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au.  With
version 0.9.7 the package was renamed to 'limma' and became part of
the Bioconductor project at http://www.bioconductor.org.
