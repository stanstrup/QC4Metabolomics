Description: Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based
    multiple testing procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for
    controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized
    family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion
    of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR). Several
    choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are implemented
    (centered, centered and scaled, quantile-transformed). Single-step
    and step-wise methods are available. Tests based on a variety of t-
    and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression
    parameters from linear and survival models as well as those based
    on correlation parameters) are included.  When probing hypotheses
    with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster null
    distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and
    variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence
    function.  Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values,
    confidence regions and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are
    directly applicable to identifying differentially expressed genes
    in DNA microarray experiments.
