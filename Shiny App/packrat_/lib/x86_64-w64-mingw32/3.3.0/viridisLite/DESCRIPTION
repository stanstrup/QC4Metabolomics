Description: Port of the new 'matplotlib' color maps ('viridis' - the
    default -, 'magma', 'plasma' and 'inferno') to 'R'. 'matplotlib'
    <http://matplotlib.org/ > is a popular plotting library for
    'python'. These color maps are designed in such a way that they
    will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in
    regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. They are
    also designed to be perceived by readers with the most common form
    of color blindness. This is the 'lite' version of the more complete
    'viridis' package that can be found at
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>.
