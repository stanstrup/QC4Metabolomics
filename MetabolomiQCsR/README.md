## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [git-lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=installation_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs#installing) *if* you want to modify the program.
* Everything else will be downloaded automatically when you create the container (or build the docker image manually)

## Getting started
To get started please read the appropriate articles available in the upper panel starting with "running the demo".\
When that is working nicely you can move on to "running your own system".
