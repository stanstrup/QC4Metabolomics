If you upgrade to a new version of the system it might include a newer version of the database software, MariaDB. If so you might need to manually update the database, thought it should happen automatically for most updates.


While the containers are running login to the database container:

```bash
docker exec -it qc4metabolomics-mariadb-1 bash
```

Then upgrade the DB:

```bash
mysql_upgrade -p
```

Restart the containers. Now warnings/errors should disappear.
