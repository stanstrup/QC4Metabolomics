Description: A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser
    desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other
    two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly
    used plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive
    features, namely baseline subtraction methods such as morphological
    filters (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative
    peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak alignment using warping
    functions, handling of replicated measurements as well as allowing
    spectra with different resolutions.
