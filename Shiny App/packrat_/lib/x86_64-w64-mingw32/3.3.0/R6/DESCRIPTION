Package: R6
Title: Classes with Reference Semantics
Version: 2.2.0
Authors@R: person("Winston", "Chang", role = c("aut", "cre"), email =
    "winston@stdout.org")
Description: The R6 package allows the creation of classes with
    reference semantics, similar to R's built-in reference classes.
    Compared to reference classes, R6 classes are simpler and
    lighter-weight, and they are not built on S4 classes so they do not
    require the methods package. These classes allow public and private
    members, and they support inheritance, even when the classes are
    defined in different packages.
