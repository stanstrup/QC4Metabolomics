Description: Support for the foreach looping construct.  Foreach is an
    idiom that allows for iterating over elements in a collection,
    without the use of an explicit loop counter.  This package in
    particular is intended to be used for its return value, rather than
    for its side effects.  In that sense, it is similar to the standard
    lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation of a function.
    Using foreach without side effects also facilitates executing the
    loop in parallel.
