# colourpicker 0.3

2016-12-05

- Added an awesome `plotHelper()` gadget+addin that makes it easy to pick colours in a plot and see in real time the updated plot as you choose new colours (#1)
- Added keyboard shortcuts for `colourPicker()` (left/right arrows to navigate the colours, 1-9 to select a colour, spacebar to add a colour...)
- don't error out if a HEX value containing alpha transparency is passed to a `colourInput()` (#4 - thanks @ddiez)
