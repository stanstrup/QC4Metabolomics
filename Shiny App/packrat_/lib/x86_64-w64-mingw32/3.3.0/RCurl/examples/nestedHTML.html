The goal of this example is to show how we can parse and HTML document
and download the files to which it has links, i.e. &lt;a href=...&gt;
elements. As we process the original document, we arrange to download
the others.  There are three possible "obvious" approaches.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"> One approach is to parse the original document in entirety
and extract its links (either by fetching the document and then parsing it or 
 "on the fly" by connecting the output of the curl request directly to the xml parser).
We then download each of those linked documents.
</li><li class="listitem"> Another approach is to start the parsing of the top-level
document and when we  encounter a link, we immediately
download that and then continue on with the parsing of the original
document. In other words, when we encounter a link, we hand control
to the downloading of that link.
</li><li class="listitem">
 An intermediate approach is to parse the first document and as we
 encounter a link, send a request for that document and arrange to
 have it be processed concurrently with the other documents.
 Essentially, we arrange for the processing of the links to be done
 asynchronously.  Having encountered a link, we don't wait until it is completely downloaded
 and nor do wait to download all of the links after we have processed the original document.
 Rather, we add a request to download the link as we encounter it and continue processing.
</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Asynchronous, concurrent link processing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id1171787141342"></a>Asynchronous, concurrent link processing</h2></div></div></div>

The strategy in this approach is to start the parsing of the original
document.  We do this in almost exactly the same way that we do in the
<a class="ulink" href="xmlParse.xml" target="_top">xmlParser</a> example.  That is, we
create a multi CURL handler and we create a function that will feed
data from the HTTP response to the XML parser when it is required.  We
then put the downloading of the original/top-level file on the stack
for the multi handler.
<pre xmlns="" class="S">

uri = "http://www.omegahat.net/index.html"
uri = "http://www.omegahat.net/RCurl/philosophy.xml"

multiHandle = getCurlMultiHandle()
streams = HTTPReaderXMLParser(multiHandle, save = TRUE)

curl = getCurlHandle(URL = uri, writefunction = streams$getHTTPResponse)
multiHandle = push(multiHandle, curl)

</pre>
<br xmlns=""><sup>[<a id="id1171787337152" href="#ftn.id1171787337152" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>


At this point, the initial HTTP request has not actually been performed
and therefore there is  no data. 
And this is good. We want to start the XML parser.
So we establish the handlers that will process
the elements of interest in our document,
e.g. a &lt;ulink&gt; for a Docbook document, or &lt;a&gt; for an
HTML document.
The function <i xmlns="" class="rfunc">downloadLinks()
</i> is the 
function used to do this.
And now we are ready to start the XML parser
via a call to <i xmlns="" class="rfunc">xmlEventParse()
</i>.

<pre xmlns="" class="S">
links = downloadLinks(multiHandle, "http://www.omegahat.net", "ulink", "url", verbose = TRUE)
xmlEventParse(streams$supplyXMLContent, handlers = links, saxVersion = 2)
</pre>
<br xmlns="">

At this point, the XML parser asks for some input.  It calls the supplyXMLContent
and this fetches data from the HTTP reply. In our case, this will
cause the HTTP request to be sent to the server and we will wait until
we get the first part of the document.  The XML parser then takes this
chunk and parses it.  When it encounters an element of interest,
i.e. a ulink, it calls the approriate handler function given in
<b xmlns="" class="$" title="">links</b>.  And this gets the URI of the link and then
arranges to add to the multi handle an HTTP request to fetch that
document.  The next time that the multi curl handle is requested to
get input for the XML parser, it will send that new HTTP request and
the response will be available.  The write handler for the new HTTP
request simply collects all the text for the document into a single
string. We use <i xmlns="" class="rfunc">basicTextGatherer()
</i> for this.

<p></p>
There is one last little detail before we can access the results. It
is possible that the XML event parser will have digested all its input
before the downloads for the other documents have finished.  There
will be nothing causing libcurl to return to process those HTTP
responses.  So they may be stuck in limbo, with input pending but
nobody paying attention.  To ensure that this doesn't happen, we can
use the <i xmlns="" class="rfunc">complete()
</i> function to complete all the pending
transactions on the multi handle.
<pre xmlns="" class="S">
complete(multiHandle)
</pre>
<br xmlns=""><p></p>
And now that we have guaranteed that all the processing
is done (or an error has occurred), we can access the results.
The result of calling <i xmlns="" class="rfunc">downloadLinks()
</i> 
gives us a function to access the download documents.
<pre xmlns="" class="S">
links$contents()
</pre>
<br xmlns=""><p></p>
To get the original document also, we have to look inside the
<b xmlns="" class="$" title="">streams</b> object and ask it for the contents that it
downloaded.  This is why we called
<i xmlns="" class="rfunc">HTMLReaderXMLParser()
</i> with <i xmlns=""><code>TRUE</code></i> for the
<i xmlns="" class="rarg">save</i> argument.


<p></p>

The definition of the XML event handlers is reasonably straightforward
at this point.  We need a handler function for the link element that
adds an HTTP request for the link document to the multi curl handle.
And we need a way to get the resulting text back when the request is
completed.  We maintain a list of text gatherer objects in the
variable <b xmlns="" class="$" title="">docs</b>.  These are indexed by the names of the
documents being downloaded.

<p></p>

The function that processes a link element in the XML document merely
determines whether the document is already being downloaded (to avoid
duplicating the work) or not.  If not, it pushes the new request for
that document onto the curl handle and returns.  This is the function
<i xmlns="" class="rfunc">op()
</i>.

<p></p>

There are details about dealing with relative links.  We have ignored
them here and only dealt with links that have an explicit
<span class="emphasis"><em>http:</em></span> prefix.


<pre xmlns="" class="rfunction">

downloadLinks =
function(curlm, base, elementName = "a", attr = "href", verbose = FALSE)
{
 docs = list()

 contents = function() { 
    sapply(docs, function(x) x$value())
 }

 ans =  list(docs = function() docs,
             contents = contents)


 op = function(name, attrs, ns, namespaces) {

   if(attr %in% names(attrs)) {

      u = attrs[attr]
      if(length(grep("^http:")) == 0)
         return(FALSE)

      if(!(u %in% names(docs))) {
         if(verbose)
            cat("Adding", u, "to document list\n")
         write = basicTextGatherer()
         curl = getCurlHandle(URL = u, writefunction = write$update)
         curlm &lt;&lt;- push(curlm, curl)

         docs[[u]] &lt;&lt;- write
      }
   }

   TRUE
 }

 ans[elementName] = op
 
 ans
}
