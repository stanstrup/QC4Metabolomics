    o better argument checking for select and related methods

    o keys that end with ' will no longer cause grief except to
    hapless life scientists who will still have to wonder who in their

    same except end with a 'prime'.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.22.0

		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.20.x

NEW FEATURES

    o There is a new introductory vignette for AnnotationDbi.  It
    explains how to use the new simplified select method interface and
    also describes how developers can implement their own select
    interfaces for exposing new annotation resources.

    o select support has been added for both the inparanoid and
    reactome.db packages.  These are in addition to existing support
    for all ChipDb, OrgDb, and TranscriptDb packages.  GO.db also has
    a select interface.

    o Code has been added to enhance backwards compatibility between
    select and bimaps.  The aim here is that old code that uses bimaps
    should still work with packages that have the same kind of data
    exposed using only a select() interface.


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o AnnotationDbi has been split up and simplified.  All code needed
    for building and supporting new packages has been moved to a new
    package called AnnotationForge.  The remaining code is what is
    needed to support day-to-day interaction with the Annotation
    interface.


BUG FIXES AND CODE MAINTENANCE

    o The code for generating bimaps has been simplified and overhauled.

    o The code for making manual pages in annotation packages has been
    simplified so that there will be far less redundancy

    o The select(), cols, keys, and keytypes methods saw several bug
    fixes and a code overhaul to enhance both speed and reliablity.

	*	        1.16.x SERIES NEWS		 *
	*						 *
	**************************************************


		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.16

NEW FEATURES

    o New Object types: Org.Db, ChipDb, GODb.  These are loaded when
    an Annotation package is loaded.

    o select method for these new objects to extract data.frames of
    available annotations.  Users can specify keys, along with the
    keytype, and the columns of data that they want extracted from the
    annotation package.

    o keys now will operate on new objects to expose most ID types as keys

    o keytypes will show which kinds of IDs can be used as a key by select

    o cols will display the kinds of data that can be extracted by select

    o Users who need organism packages for organisms that are
    annotated at NCBI can now use makeOrgPackageFromNCBI() to generate
    a basic organism package on the fly

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o New objects are always named after the package that loaded them.
    So if you just loaded the hgu95av2.db package, your ChipDb object
    will be called hgu95av2.db

    o new fields are now required in the metadata table of annotation
    packages to allow the on-the-fly creation of these new objects.
    If you are constructing a custom package and want to extend this
    infrastructure, you may need to add some fields to the metadata
    table.

BUG FIXES

    o makeProbePackage, and other generated Annotation packages have
    had templates modified so that packages can load and also to
    enable loading of new objects to allow new features in this
    release.

    o updated GOFrame constructor to allow use of new types of
    evidence codes.

    o generated packages will create databases with the appropiate
    metadata entries for the new objects.

	**************************************************


		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.9.5


NEW FEATURES

    o An organism package has been added for Streptomyces coelicolor

    o extensive overhaul of inparanoid packages means that inparanoid
    packages now match to 100 different organisms

    o Extended support for ensembl mappings to yeast and flies.

NOTEWORTHY CHANGES BETWEEN THIS version and 1.3.11

    o All chip packages now depend on org packages.  This simplifies
    the schema and also allows for more convenient updating of these
    packages and smaller downloads for users.

    o chip package mappings that contain probes which map to multiple
    targets are now hidden by default, with the ability to be exposed
    when required.  See the use of the new toggleProbes() method.

    o Support has been added for 3 more organisms, this means that the
    current list of supported organisms as of 1.3.11 is the following:
    	    Arabidopsis thaliana

    o Added support for GO to canine and pig packages by using
    BLAST2GO (this data was not available from NCBI for these
    organisms).

    o ZFIN IDs are supported for Zebrafish packages.

    o Wormbase IDs are supported for C. elegans packages.

    o Uniprot IDs have been added to almost all package types.

    o CHRLOCEND mapping has been added which give gene end positions
    for almost all packages and compliments the CHRLOC mapping which
    already provides the start positions.

		CHANGES IN AnnotationDbi VERSION 1.1.7


NEW FEATURES

    o	Annotation packages now have a function to display basic 
    	quality control information.

    	involving homology.

    o	Ensembl gene ID maps have been added to all mammalian 
    	packages.

    o	MGI IDs maps have been added for all Mouse packages.

    o	Protein to gene mappings have been added to appropriate 
    	organism based packages so that it will be possible to get 
	from the IDs in the inparanoid packages to a gene based ID 
	for the 5 main organism types (ie. Human, Mouse, Rat, Fly, 
	Yeast).

    o	Support has been added for PFAM so that there can now be a 
    	PFAM.db package.

    o	AnnotationDbi is now compliant with the 1.0 schema definition.
